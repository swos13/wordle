# Wordie

Recreation of game Wordle with React in Next.js. App built using React (in Next.js).
Redux Toolkit was used for state management on client side.

Deployed app - https://wordie-swos13s-projects.vercel.app/

Main difference to the original game is that user submits answer through keyobard inputs.
Also word is randomly choosen before each game, so user might try to guess as many words as they want.
Therefore, at the bottom of the page there are two stats that tell user how successful they are at guessing the 5 letter words.
